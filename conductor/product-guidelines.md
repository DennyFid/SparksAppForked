# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice

The primary tone for all SparksApp communication, including interactions with the Sparksmith Agent, will be **Concise and Direct**. This approach prioritizes efficiency and clarity, appealing to developers who value straightforward instructions and minimal fluff.

## Core Design Principles

The development of new sparks must adhere to the following principles:

### Modularity and Independence

Each spark should be a self-contained unit that does not create dependencies on other sparks. However, sparks should leverage common `src` components (e.g., `SettingsComponents`) and services (e.g., `GeminiService`) to ensure the platform remains stable and easy to maintain. This modularity is key to preventing a complex web of dependencies that could destabilize the application.

### Visual and Experiential Consistency

New sparks must adopt the existing visual language and interaction patterns of the SparksApp. Maintaining a unified visual language and user experience across the app reinforces brand identity and provides a predictable, seamless experience for users.

## Brand Messaging

SparksApp is positioned as **a streamlined tool for rapid prototyping and deployment, making native mobile development accessible to a broad audience.** Our messaging should emphasize the speed and efficiency with which developers can bring their ideas to life, democratizing mobile development for everyone from seasoned coders to enthusiastic beginners.
